# What is the Demon Core Simulator?
The Demon Core Simulator is an interactive exhibit that aims to provide a simulated version of [the first demon core incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core#First_incident) where a sphere of plutonium unexpectedly went supercritical in a laboratory when a researcher made a fatal mistake.

# Goals
- Provide a cool interactive experience centered around an infamous historical event
- Have an accurate 1:1 model of the real thing, including the approximate weight of the top neutron reflector
- Give people the opportunity to test their screw driver holding skills
- Educate about nuclear safety
